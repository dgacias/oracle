# oracle
startoradbservices.sh

Script to start all Oracle Database services. You can use this script on machine start to ensure everything is up and running.
You can invoke this script while database is already running, if a service is already started it will warn you that you can't start it because it is already started so feel free to invoke it without breaking already running stuff.
